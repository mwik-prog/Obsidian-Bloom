#**Welcome to Obsidian Sound: For the Underground Ready to Rise**
###*By Diana Mulwa, Founder _Obsidian Sound_*

There’s a quiet power in the underground.
It’s raw. It’s restless. It’s ready.
That’s what Obsidian Sound is here for:
to amplify the unheard, to guide the gifted, and to shine a light on the hidden gems of the Kenyan and African music scene.
We’re not just building a blog.
We’re creating a movement for the artists who don’t fit the mold, but are bold enough to break it.


##**Who This Blog is For**
'''
You’re a singer recording tracks in your bedroom. 
You’re a rapper spitting bars no one’s heard yet. 
You’re a producer sending beats across WhatsApp hoping someone listens. 
You’re that artist who knows you have it, but no one’s plugged you in. 
'''
This blog is your plug.
We talk A&R, industry moves, how to grow, get seen, and stay true to your sound.


##**Why I Started Obsidian Sound**
I’ve watched too many dope artists go unseen, unheard, unsigned not because they lack talent, but because they lack strategy, direction, or simply visibility.
Obsidian, like the black crystal, is formed under pressure.
So is greatness. And we’re here to unearth it.
This is my way of building a bridge from the underground to the global stage.
